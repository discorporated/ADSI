Art Doesn't Steal It's Self

- by lil PDF



This is my submission to the Global Game Jam 2021. The theme of 'Lost & Found' is represented in a virtual reality game, where players hunt for famous stolen art-works while water floods a 'secret-art bunker.'


In a time of NFT's, it is worth looking back at the long history of art being used as objects of wealth and value, often stolen away from the very creators, and placed in secret illicit private colletions around the world.

We hear of the stories of found abandoned masterworks, recovered war prizes, and newly discovered un-destroyed pieces, that sometimes are eventually returned to the original owner's estates, but where are they at this moment?

In my first Game Jam submission and Virtual Reality game built on the open-VR standard, I learned many things that have helped grow my C# coding skills
